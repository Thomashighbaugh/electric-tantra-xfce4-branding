# the Electric Tantra Branding for XFCE4

While the intention of the Electric Tantra Linux is demonstrating my AwesomeWM configuration, that is roughly fully featured and should not require another distro upon its final release and subsequent updates to it, I none the less have need to keep around a modified XFCE4 for situations where I need to do something GUI related and want a more seamless environment to use than is standard with XFCE4, which I employ the underpinnings of in my AwesomeWM configuration due to its functionality being consistent and polished compared to Gnome or Plasma. 

## Branding Considerations 
This configuration of the XML files underpinning XFCE4 as it is displayed on screen reduce the screen resolution occupied by bars and other distractions, reducing them to a single bottom bar that is more tolerable when large than the two two bars together are and provides a familiar look to windows users (which I care little about but still its there).In order to immediately cue my eye as to which DE it is, I have allowed the bar to different in color from my AwesomeWM configuration.
